Not that Oppo had IP-rated phones before that, but in case you were wondering – the Reno is neither water, nor dust protected officially. The teardowns are yet to reveal if there are some ingress sealings as was the case with the OnePlus 7, though we still would keep the phone away from water just in case.",
